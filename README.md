# CS412_Machine_Learning_Spring24
 This repository contains homeworks made for CS 412 Machine Learning course in Spring 2024 semester.
 Welcome to my machine learning homework repository! ü§ñ

This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my homework assignments from the machine learning course instructed by √ñznur Ta≈ütan Okan during the Spring semester of 2024 at Sabancƒ± University. Throughout this course, Python has been our primary tool for exploring and implementing various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Each homework assignment is thoughtfully organized within its own directory, accompanied by Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and any additional resources required for completion. From foundational concepts like regression and classification to more advanced topics such as neural networks, ensemble methods, and dimensionality reduction, I've delved into the fascinating realm of machine learning with enthusiasm and rigor.

Feel free to explore the implementations, analyses, and insights garnered from each assignment. Whether you're a fellow student seeking inspiration or an enthusiast eager to dive into the world of machine learning, this repository offers a comprehensive glimpse into the practical applications of Python in the field of data science and artificial intelligence.

Have questions, feedback, or ideas for collaboration? Don't hesitate to reach out and engage in discussions. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and innovation in machine learning together! üöÄüîç
